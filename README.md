# CS_5900_Project Status
I have divided my Interim status into 3 sections as I'm working on all them simultaneously
#### Webscrapping
I have done webscrapping on USGS website which is being dynamically populated. 
One of the sample download has been attached web.py. I'm yet to work on downloading multiple .tif files simultaneously.
#### Image Processing
I am going to use 4 different tif files. One of the terrain to be populated needs to be merged, which I have converted into pandas and merged the two data frames. 
The issue is with the merged image, where some of the coordinate data is lost and there is a blank space between the two images (Need to work on this part)
#### Game Engine
In-Progress
